  final look at @ decorator to make classes and methods thread safe (using Lock)
- multiprocessing
- performance and timing
- profiling with @profile and cProfile
- after lunch review exercise
- why use a thread or a process
- generators
- prepare for Thursday ...

Thursday
- Python for Data Analysis
  we will need:
  - jupyter
  - numpy
  - pandas
  - matplotlib
	The easiest way to get all the bits and bobs is to use Anaconda
  data sources (csv, xlsx, text, db, url...)
- using Jupyter notebooks (via Jupyter, Anaconda, via VS Code plugin, or online or...)
   you can 'pip install jupyter' then start it with 'python -m notebook'
   then you will also need to pip install numpy, pandas etc.
- numpy and data structures: the arange and array 
- pandas: series and data-frame
- data vizualisation with matplotlib
- data cleansing and preparation
- descriptive statistics
- handling files and remote data
- after lunch review exercise
- careful - exporting a notebook does not add 'print' statements

Friday
- review of microservices
- Flask: running as dev or prod server (performance and security)
  to run as a debug server: flask --app my_flask.py --debug run
  or else debug=True in the app declaration
  see https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.2.x/
- after lunch review exercise
- end of course feedback
